# SYNC_RULES (Public)

## Role
This repository is the **public release** track.

## Intake source
- Primary source: `../persona-builder-web` (beta/internal)

## Rules
1. Accept only curated, release-safe changes from beta.
2. Keep public-only files stable (PWA manifests, SW files, release scripts).
3. Never copy internal notes/checklists into public.
4. Prefer smaller intake batches for easier review.

## Release gate
- [ ] Boundary check passes
- [ ] Smoke check passes
- [ ] Version bumped
- [ ] Changelog updated
